## NextRead

### üìñ Project Description

NextRead is a book recommendation website designed to help users discover their next read based on specific, curated learning goals rather than generic genres. Whether you want to master a new skill, explore a historical period, or understand a complex topic, NextRead provides a tailored list of books to guide your learning journey.

The platform is built with a secure login system using **JSON Web Tokens (JWT)** to manage user sessions, protecting user data and enabling personalized experiences like tracking rated books. A key feature allows users to rate books, which instantly updates the book's overall score for the entire community. To provide insightful previews, the application leverages the **Google Gemini API** to automatically generate high-quality book summaries. These summaries are generated once and then saved, ensuring they load instantly for all future visitors, which enhances performance and reduces API costs.

### ‚ú® Key Features

* **Goal-Oriented Recommendations:** Find books curated to help you achieve specific learning or development goals.
* **Secure User Authentication:** A robust login and registration system built with JWT for secure session management.
* **Dynamic Book Ratings:** Users can rate books, and the average score is instantly calculated and displayed for everyone.
* **AI-Generated Summaries:** Uses the Google Gemini API to automatically generate concise and informative book summaries.
* **Optimized Performance:** Summaries are cached after the first generation to ensure they load instantly for all subsequent users, improving page speed and user experience.

* **Frontend:** React <!-- Add your specific framework like React, Vue, etc. if you used one -->
* **Backend:** Fast API
